Incremental design improvements could involve updating the UI with a modern color scheme or adding subtle animations. I should look for areas where the design feels outdated or lacks visual appeal., Modern React patterns like using Suspense for code splitting and adopting the App Router can enhance the structure and performance of the application. I'll assess if these patterns are already in use and suggest implementations where they aren't., SEO improvements might involve adding more descriptive meta tags and structured data. I'll look into the current setup and see where additional optimizations can be made to help with search engine rankings." buildId="73cvksl5d" generatedAt="6:00:43 PM" />
