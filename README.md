# Iterative Improvement - 8/5/2025

Applied improvements: Next, the additional focus areas include design, performance, accessibility, React patterns, and SEO. I need to think of specific, actionable improvements without overhauling the existing design. For design, maybe adding a loading spinner would enhance user experience. Performance-wise, using React.memo could help with component re-renders. Accessibility is important, so adding ARIA labels and semantic HTML elements would be good steps., Modern React patterns like Suspense for data fetching could make the app more efficient. SEO improvements might involve dynamic titles and meta tags. I should also consider adding analytics for better tracking, but that's optional., I need to make sure each suggestion is clear and implementable. For example, when suggesting environment variable fixes, I should provide exact code snippets. For design improvements, maybe outline where to add the spinner and how to style it. Performance tips should include specific React hooks or optimizations.
