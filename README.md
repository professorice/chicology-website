# Iterative Improvement - 8/3/2025

Applied improvements: Next, the additional focus areas include design improvements, performance, accessibility, modern React patterns, and SEO. I'll need to think of specific, actionable changes in each area without overhauling the current design., For design, maybe adding a loading spinner or toast notifications could enhance the user experience. Performance-wise, implementing React.memo or lazy loading might help. Accessibility could involve adding ARIA labels or using semantic HTML. Modern patterns might include state management with Context or Redux. SEO improvements could involve setting up a sitemap or using proper meta tags., I should also consider how to structure these improvements incrementally. Perhaps prioritize the critical fixes first, then move on to the other areas, ensuring each change is implementable and builds upon the current design.
