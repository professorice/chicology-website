# Iterative Improvement - 8/9/2025

Applied improvements: Next, the additional focus areas are incremental design improvements, performance, accessibility, modern React patterns, and SEO. I need to suggest specific, actionable changes without replacing the current design., For accessibility, I'll add ARIA labels to form elements and ensure proper contrast ratios. Using semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, and <main> will enhance accessibility., SEO improvements can be made by adding structured data using JSON-LD scripts in main.tsx. This helps search engines understand the page content better.
