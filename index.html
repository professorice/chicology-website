    <title>Chicology - Iterative Improvement - 8/12/2025 | Generated 8/12/2025</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Applied improvements: Moving on to the additional focus areas, I need to suggest incremental improvements. Let's think about each area:, 1. **Incremental Design Improvements**: Maybe adding a loading spinner or a toast notification system could enhance the user experience without overhauling the design. Using a library like react-toastify would be a good start., 2. **Performance Optimizations**: Implementing code splitting with dynamic imports and using React.memo could help reduce the initial load time and optimize rendering. Also, lazy loading images would improve performance on slower networks. - Unique build ID: gpi4v2ooa" />
