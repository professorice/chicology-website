    <title>Chicology - Iterative Improvement - 7/30/2025 | Generated 7/30/2025</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Applied improvements: The user provided a current state of the website, which includes some files like App.tsx and main.tsx. They mentioned critical fixes required, especially regarding environment variables for LaunchDarkly. Also, they want incremental improvements in areas like design, performance, accessibility, React patterns, and SEO., Now, moving on to the additional focus areas. Starting with incremental design improvements. Maybe the current design is a bit outdated. I can suggest using CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or Emotion to make the styling more maintainable. Also, adding subtle animations can enhance the user experience without being too flashy., SEO improvements might involve adding more descriptive meta tags and using React Helmet to manage document head elements. Proper use of semantic HTML tags can also help search engines understand the content better. - Unique build ID: s7qslg8ud" />
